# Hi, this is Saikkiy and I've made a flipping mod for everyone to try. I had a hard time starting flipping and I've never had a good mod to work with so this should fix that issue for any future players! This one is still in beta however it is much more inclusive and easy to use than other mods that are out, as of May 2022. To use the mod just install it in your mods folder then launch the game on forge 1.8.9. (PS. Skytils breaks the mod and so does NEC, so you'll need to remove both while flipping but other than that you can run the game normally.) Thank you all for downloading and I have a patreon if anyone would like to help me in making more of these mods. Happy Flipping!
