# Hi, this is Saikkiy and I've made a flipping mod for everyone to try. I had a hard time starting flipping and I've never had a good mod to work with so this should fix that issue for any future players! This one is still in beta however it is much more inclusive and easy to use than other mods that are out, as of May 2022. To use the mod just install it in your mods folder then launch the game on forge 1.8.9. (If your having a hard time with the mod not running it may be Skytils, as it has bugged the mod for some) Thank you all for downloading and I have a patreon if anyone would like to help me in making more of these mods. Happy Flipping!
